    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To re-make our blog better than it was before.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>I struggled quite a bit with the initial code, and being able to start the repository. I managed to do it though, and now my blog is up.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I went to the computer resources page to get information on the background colour and the fonts.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I went myself to w3schools to find the new code and the colours.</td>

    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I now know that you need to put brackets to get your own image behind your blog.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>It read the information available and now my blog is ready for changes.</td>

    <td>I think that I could've improved by getting started with the new repository more quickly, because it took awhile for me to start it.</td>
