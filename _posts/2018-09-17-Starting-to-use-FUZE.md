    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We got stuck with finding the 'BASIC' file, as it wasn’t on the desktop, but we found it in a FUZE file.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked in pairs, but we both had a job to do. One of us worked as the driver, and the other as the navigator.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We worked together to go through the booklet, change words, colours, and many more other things for our FUZE blog.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We had to think hard to interpret what the booklet was telling us to do, and then put it onto the computer. It sometimes wouldn’t work, but we managed to fix it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We could’ve worked quicker, as when the blog didn’t go back to the code, we then restarted the whole computer, which made it a slow process. </td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We realised that there was an easier way, of just holding escape and then pressing the F2 key, we then were able to see our changes straight away. </td>
