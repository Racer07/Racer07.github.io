    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>Me and my partner got up to the lights level in the fuze booklet. We set up and started.</td>

    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To complete more of the FUZE booklet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we completed the first level of the lights section in the FUZE booklet.</td>

    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We spent a very long time in trying to work out how to do it. We were trying for 45 minutes of the lesson, until we ended up just putting random wires in random places. Eventually it suddenly worked! The issue was that we hadn't put the first part of the red wire in the correct socket, but we managed to light the bulb.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>As we were struggling, we went to another pair in hopes of getting a clue, but the were as stuck as we were. We asked the teacher too.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We both had to look at the problem in different perspectives, so that we both didn’t get stuck on the same issue.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Although the picture in the FUZE booklet was unclear and was so that you couldn’t see all of the circuit board, we should’ve found some way to find out where each wire goes into each individual socket.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We had to stay engaged even when we were struggling. And to not  let one person do all of the work in finding the issue out.</td>

    <td>We would've looked at the booklet image and seen which wire goes into which socket, because it made the difference between us getting the bulb to light up and not.</td>
