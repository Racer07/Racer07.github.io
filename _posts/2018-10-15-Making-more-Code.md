  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To continue with the FUZE booklet.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Yes, we got up to the project 4-1.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We accidentally saved the project through the wrong file from the USB, so we carried on working and then it didn't save the work we did. We just re-did all of the lost work.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>Again, we were working in pairs but we both had to our individual jobs correctly.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>We did well, and got up to a high level in the project booklet.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>We had to focus in order to get the code right.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We worked slower than we would've liked, because we both kept missing spaces between characters in the code.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Try and get the navigator to call out all characters and spaces in order to not miss anything out.</td>
